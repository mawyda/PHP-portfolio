# PHP-portfolio
---
## Description 
This is a simple site written in PHP. It contains a "portfolio"-like front page, with contact and links to my info. Additionally, there is a page to view Blog posts created by the user, and a seperate page to Create new blog posts, including uploading an image from the users file system.

## Goals
The point of this was to challenge myself and see if I can write the backend portion, in a new language, within a day. It was also intended to be practice in CSS styling and site construction in general. 

## TODO??
* A user authentication system would be necessary if the blogs were intended for public use. 
* I may update as I see fit. For now, this was just a fun little side-project and exploratory in nature.
